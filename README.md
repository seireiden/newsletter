# 🗞️ Vintage Newsletter — Digital Malabar

Welcome to **Digital Malabar**, my handcrafted retro-style newsletter 📰 designed with a vintage newspaper layout and an animated newspaper-style loader to give readers a classic reading experience.

## ✨ Features

- 📰 **Authentic Newspaper Layout**: Inspired by 1970s print style with columns, typography, and visual media.
- ⏳ **Animated Loader**: A unique newspaper-themed loader with a skewing animation and dynamic line effects.
- 📄 **Fully Static Page**: Built entirely with a single `.html` file using HTML, CSS, and JS — no frameworks or external build tools required.
- 💬 **Responsive Design**: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.
- 🧩 **Easily Extendable**: New articles and issues can be added simply by editing the HTML structure.

## 📬 Purpose

This layout serves as the official platform for my **newsletter**. Each time there's an update, a new edition will be formatted in this newspaper layout. Think of it as a digital front page to:

- Share my latest posts, updates, and announcements
- Reflect my design aesthetic: clean, timeless, and expressive
- Host a growing archive of editions with character

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the `index.html` file.
2. Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
3. Update the HTML content to reflect your newest issue or article.
4. Host it on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static site host.

## 📁 File Structure

📄 index.html → Single HTML file with inline CSS + JS
